The original code can be found at "Software Preservation Society, Download Page"
(http://www.softpres.org/download), and the latest "User Distribution,
Windows (32, 64-bit) Platform, Version 5.1" can be downloaded from there
(http://www.softpres.org/_media/files:spsdeclib_5.1_windows.zip?id=download&cache=cache).

That version is developed on Simon's github (https://github.com/simonowen/capsimage)
which is used here but with an additional commit which is pull requested on
Simon's github at the moment of writing. While it is not accepted the
typefixnotwindows branch on GÃ¡bor's github contains the latest version
(https://github.com/gnaray/capsimage/tree/typefixnotwindows) used here.
